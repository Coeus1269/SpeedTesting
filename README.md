# SpeedTesting
Speed testing many processes, loops and structures.

There have been a number of times where me, or someone on my team have asked, "would it be faster to do it this way instead?"

this is some of the tests that we built to try and help answer the question.

BooleanSpeedTest - testing the different ways to test a boolean variable.

HashTests - testing the different hash structures.

... and others
